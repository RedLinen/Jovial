## Operation Instructions:

The operation instructions included here are for prototype three—the most advanced prototype that we were able to build. This prototype was still very early stage and lacked many of the capabilities that a more advanced prototype would have had. Instructions detailing how a more advanced version of this device might work are not included here because, in the opinion of this designer, the idea of how a product should be operated needs to move and shift as the design advances and it is possible to see, touch, carry, and drop increasingly sophisticated protypes.
